              A Message from Our Founder
            </p>

            <p>
              When I came up with Air Ceylon, it wasn’t just about travel — it
              was about transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I saw and experienced the challenges people face when navigating
              new journeys: visas, immigration, education, transitions, and the
              uncertainties that follow. Too often, these experiences were
              stressful, discouraging, and impersonal. The mission for Air Ceylon
              was born to change that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our vision is to become Sri Lanka’s main travel and transition hub
              — a place where your journey begins with clarity, support, and
              confidence. Whether you're taking flight for opportunity,
              education, or a new life abroad, we’re here to walk with you every
              step of the way. From expert visa services and immigration
              consultancy to IELTS training, travels & tours, air ticketing, and
              post-arrival (transition) support like accommodation, jobs, and
              lifestyle integration — we believe in going the extra mile, even
              after you land.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Air Ceylon, we are building more than a service. We’re building
              a bridge — between countries, between people, and between dreams
              and reality.
